I Didn't know where Lovettsville was! Then I noticed it's right across the Potomac and state line. Do you actually telecommute and teach kids remotely given the Corona situation?

I'm from out of state 31, but just started a 50k job in tech sector.

Here to stay. And I'm trying to find anyone along the Martinsville -> D.C. MARC line, which includes Brunswick, just across from you. Have access to a car, potentially 2 cars. And potentially a 3rd Roommate if you want? Choice is yours. one is female, Cristina. we all work together. it's weird.

I've been finding all the apartments & townhouses I can and mapped them. first in Frederick, Brunswick, Harpers Ferry, now in Martinsburg. and I'm looking at Metro D.C.: Germantown, Gaithersburg, & Montgomery Village as something I could potentially afford with a roommate.

I had lived in NY a year in 2019 -2020, and I can tell you I and everyone I know is immune to Corona virus now, and recovered from that horrible disease a year ago.

Please Forgive my sparse profile. :-( I've not used Roommate sites before. Was planning to go it alone. I have an out of state number, and feel embarrassed about that, because i HAD a D.C. one! and then my SIM card expired.  I live in Knoxville out in the woods at a friend's 10,000 sq ft mansion. it's hard to explain.

I Also build electric bikes..
