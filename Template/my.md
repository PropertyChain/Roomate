Hey! When you graduate, where are you planning to work from?
Do you sell stuff online? and can live from pretty much anywhere?
I'm from out of state 31, but just started a 50k job in tech sector. 

Here to stay. And I'm trying to find anyone along the Martinsville -> D.C. MARC line, which includes some of the cities you listed.
Have access to a car, potentially 2 cars. And potentially a 3rd Roommate if you want? Choice is yours. one is female. we all work together.

I've been finding all the apartments & townhouses I can and mapped them. first in Frederick, Brunswick, Harpers Ferry, now in Martinsburg. and I'm looking at Metro D.C.: Germantown, Gaithersburg, & Montgomery Village as something I could potentially afford with a roommate.

I had lived in NY a year in 2019 -2020, and I can tell you I'm immune to Corona virus now, and recovered from that horrible disease a year ago.

I Also build electric bikes..
Please Forgive my sparse profile? I've not used Roommate sites before.
