Hi India!
If you're 21 and in school, does that mean your graduating in May?
This will sound strange as hell, but I figure - why not?..

I'm from out of state, Louisiana 31, but just started a secure 50k job in tech sector. in Knoxville md.

Here to stay! And I'm trying to find anyone along the Martinsville -> D.C. MARC line, which includes a bunch of cities and suburbs Northwest of D.C.

I've been finding all the apartments & townhouses I can and mapped them. first in Frederick, Brunswick, Harpers Ferry, now in Martinsburg. and I'm looking at Metro D.C.: Germantown, Gaithersburg, & Montgomery Village as something I could potentially afford with a roommate.

I had lived in NY a year in 2019 -2020, and I can tell you I and everyone I know is immune to Corona virus now, and recovered from that horrible disease a year ago.

Please Forgive my sparse profile. :-| I've not used Roommate sites before. Was planning to go it alone. I have an out of state number, and feel embarrassed about that, because i HAD a D.C. one! and then my SIM card expired. I live in Knoxville out in the woods at a friend's 11,500 sq ft mansion. it's hard to explain. Before it was a job - it was an incubator and I pretty much sleep on bean bags, extra beds, couches, whatever's available. Have access to a car, potentially 2 cars. And potentially a 3rd or 4th Roommate if you want? Choice is yours. one is female, Cristina, she's 36. we all work together. it's weird. it's not a cult. We all really are just friends in a weird but fortunate situation.

I Also build electric bikes.. I'm trying to boost my income to over 100k so I really can live in a "Dream Apartment" or home in Downtown D.C. that's all I really want in life. :-(

I feel like I talk about too much.. and I don't want to. :-/

Tell me about You?? :-)

You want a Real Estate license? How long do you think it would take you if you had access to good resources? allies? were out of school? and started doing it full time?
